            <h2> What is Meal Ticket?</h2>

            <p>
              Meal ticket is a food delivery app where other people buy food for low-income houses.

      <h3>How will it work?</h3>

      <p class="col-md-8">
        Meal Ticket will partner with schools in low-income neighborhoods such as  Brightmoor, Detroit. 
        From there each student will get a form which will ask them things like how many people are in their family and do they have any allergies; 
        If they fill out that form and turn it in their family gets added to the meal ticket app where other people can buy their groceries. 
        From there people can download the app and choose which family they would like to help. 
        The app will prevent the issue of people helping the same families by making them unavailable if they just got food ordered for them.

          <p class="col-md-6">
            The only requirement is that you have to make less than the yearly income needed to live a comfortable life for the number of family members in your house. 
            If you make the amount or above then you wonâ€™t need other people to buy your groceries. 
            Our main goal is to feed those who have to choose between whether they want to pay the heating bill or be able to eat today.
